* [2025-12-30] Dev Log: UI Polish & Rebrand Session              :UI:REBRAND:

** Context
Extended UI polish session addressing 7+ visual/interaction bugs, followed by
strategic rebrand from "Claude Code Explorer" to just "ccx".

** Why
User feedback identified multiple UX inconsistencies and visual issues that
degraded the perceived quality. Rebrand needed to reduce confusion for new users.

** What

*** UI/UX Fixes (12 items)
| Fix                      | Description                                        |
|--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| Live button animation    | Animate existing icon, not add another dot         |
| Theme flash              | Inline script in <head> before CSS loads           |
| Search badges            | Unified P/S/M colored badges across all search UIs |
| Global search format     | Same result format in TopNav and Search page       |
| Fold/tools conflict      | Fixed broken click handler (checks always true)    |
| Tail mode scroll         | Auto-scroll to bottom when enabling                |
| Tail mode toggles        | Auto-enable Think/Tools when tailing starts        |
| Tail spinner position    | Left-aligned, below last block                     |
| Fold separator           | Clickable +N pill between user and final response  |
| Icon system              | SVG brand icon, geometric icons, removed emojis    |
| Markdown tailing         | Full feature parity (tables, headers, lists)       |
| Rebrand                  | Removed "Explorer", now "ccx for Claude Code"      |

*** Fold Architecture
- Thread fold: click user header toggles .thread.folded class
- Fold separator: clickable pill showing "+N > ... o" between user and response
- Tool details: independent <details> elements
- Think/Tools toggles: control block visibility globally

*** Icon System (Unified)
| Location        | Icons Used                              |
|-----------------+-----------------------------------------|
| Brand           | SVG: c(coral) c(green) x(orange)        |
| Header          | Theme toggle, Settings: geometric       |
| Toolbar         | Think, Tools, Live, Export: geometric    |
| Settings page   | Sections: filled/outline diamonds/circles |
| Turns           | User, Assistant, Command, Meta: geometric |

*** Rebrand
- Before: "Claude Code Explorer", "ccx is a CLI tool for exploring..."
- After: "ccx", "Session viewer for Claude Code"
- Header: ccx [icon] + "for Claude Code"

** Decisions
| Decision                          | Rationale                                       |
|-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Keep "ccx" not "ccex"             | Shorter, X = flexible meaning                   |
| Remove "Explorer" entirely        | Reduces confusion, cleaner identity             |
| Geometric icons over emojis       | Consistent, professional, no font dependencies  |
| Fold separator clickable          | Two ways to unfold = better discovery           |
| Auto-enable toggles when tailing  | Toolbar should reflect actual content state     |

** Files Changed
- internal/web/templates.go (major - UI/CSS/JS)
- internal/cmd/root.go (CLI description)
- README.md (tagline)
- DEVLOG.org (about section, entry links)
- docs/devlog/* (restructured)

** WIP
- [X] UI/UX fixes (12 items)
- [X] Rebrand
- [X] Devlog restructure to docs/devlog/
- [ ] Shell completions
- [ ] ccx search CLI command

** Notes

*** Fold Handler Bug (Root Cause)
The checks =e.target.closest('details')= and =e.target.closest('summary')=
were ALWAYS true because userHeader IS a <summary> inside a <details>.
Handler never ran, only browser's default details toggle happened.

*** Markdown Parity
renderMarkdownJS() now matches Go renderMarkdown():
- Code blocks with language class
- Tables with thead/tbody
- Headers h1-h4
- Lists ul/li
- Inline: code, bold, italic, links

*** Devlog Restructure
Moved from fragmented locations to unified docs/devlog/:
- /worktree/ccx/devlog/* -> /worktree/ccx/docs/devlog/*
- /dev-logs/* -> /worktree/ccx/docs/devlog/*
