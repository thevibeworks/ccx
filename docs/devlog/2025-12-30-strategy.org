* [2025-12-30] Dev Log: ccx Strategic Direction & Vision        :STRATEGY:PLANNING:

** Context
Strategic planning session for ccx (Claude Code eXplorer → Claude Code X) to define product direction, target personas, and roadmap validation approach.

** Why
Define clear product vision beyond initial session inspection tool, explore expansion into "Claude Code as a Service" territory, and validate market fit before over-building.

** What
- Product naming: Retained "ccx" (short, memorable, X = flexible/extensible meaning)
- Rejected "ccex" (phonetically awkward, longer, less memorable)
- Defined 5 target user personas with distinct needs
- Mapped 7 use case domains beyond pure coding workflows
- Established phased approach: validate → share → signal → expand

** How
*** Strategic Path
1. Phase 1-4 (Weeks 1-4): Build core inspection value (parser, CLI, export, web) per SPEC.md
2. Gather early user feedback on session browsing/search/export utility
3. Add lightweight sharing (read-only session links, no auth initially)
4. Collect signal on remote execution demand (surveys, usage metrics)
5. Expand to "CC as a Service" if warranted by signal strength

*** Core Value Proposition (Current)
- Session inspection: Tree-aware rendering of Claude Code conversations
- Real-time tailing: Monitor live CC sessions as they run
- Cross-session search: Find past solutions, tool patterns, decisions
- Multi-format export: HTML (standalone), Markdown (GFM), Org-mode (Emacs)
- Structured views: Isolated tool calls, thinking blocks, agent sidechains

*** Future Direction: "Claude Code as a Service"
- Remote CC execution: Run Claude Code on server, not local machine
- Multi-user access: Teams share projects, sessions, learnings
- Centralized management: Org-wide policies, quotas, cost tracking
- Audit/compliance trails: Immutable logs for regulated industries

** Decisions
| Decision                     | Alternatives                          | Rationale                                          | DRI   | Timestamp (UTC)    |
|------------------------------+---------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+-------+--------------------|
| Keep "ccx" naming            | ccex, cce, cc-explorer                | Short, memorable, X = versatile/extensible meaning | @eric | 2025-12-30T00:00Z  |
| Build Phase 1-4 first        | Jump to remote execution immediately  | Validate core value before adding complexity       | @eric | 2025-12-30T00:00Z  |
| Target 5 personas initially  | Focus on devs only                    | Broader TAM, non-coder market underserved          | @eric | 2025-12-30T00:00Z  |
| Lightweight sharing in Phase | Heavy auth/collab from start          | Test demand signal before infrastructure spend     | @eric | 2025-12-30T00:00Z  |

** Target User Personas
*** 1. Terminal Power Users
- Need: Session history search, CLI-native workflows
- Pain: Lost context from old sessions, no grep-able transcript archive
- Value: =ccx sessions --sort=time | ccx view @1= for instant recall

*** 2. Team Leads / Engineering Managers
- Need: Visibility into team AI usage, shared learnings library
- Pain: Each dev has isolated CC knowledge, no cross-pollination
- Value: Centralized session browser, export curated solutions to wiki

*** 3. Content Creators (Tutorial Writers, Bloggers, Video Producers)
- Need: Clean transcripts for tutorials, embeddings for blogs/videos
- Pain: Manual copy-paste from CC UI, messy formatting, lost thinking steps
- Value: HTML export with syntax highlighting, Markdown for blogs

*** 4. Compliance Officers / Enterprise Auditors
- Need: Audit trails for AI-generated code, on-prem deployment
- Pain: SaaS-only tools, no immutable logs, can't meet SOC2/HIPAA
- Value: Read-only session logs, export to SIEM, air-gapped deployment

*** 5. Non-Coders (PMs, Designers, Analysts)
- Need: Learn with Claude Code, document AI workflows, share results
- Pain: Terminal intimidation, no GUI for browsing old sessions
- Value: =ccx web= for GUI browsing, export to Notion/Confluence

** Use Cases Beyond Coding
*** 1. Technical Documentation
- Export CC sessions to Markdown/Org for inclusion in docs repos
- Generate API reference examples directly from CC exploration
- Document decision rationale with full AI conversation context

*** 2. Data Analysis / Data Scientists
- Preserve Jupyter-like exploration sessions with Claude Code
- Share reproducible analysis workflows via exported sessions
- Search past analytical approaches across projects

*** 3. DevOps / SRE
- Incident response documentation with CC assistance captured
- Runbook generation from CC-guided troubleshooting
- Post-mortem artifacts from interactive debugging sessions

*** 4. Education / Training
- Curate exemplar CC sessions for student learning
- Export step-by-step problem-solving transcripts
- Build curriculum from real AI-assisted coding workflows

*** 5. Research / Academia
- Archive research exploration sessions for reproducibility
- Export to LaTeX/Org for academic paper appendices
- Share methodology with peer reviewers via CC transcripts

*** 6. Product / Technical PMs
- Document feature exploration with Claude Code assistance
- Export requirements refinement sessions to PRD tools
- Share technical feasibility analysis with stakeholders

*** 7. QA / Test Engineers
- Capture test strategy brainstorming with Claude Code
- Export test case generation sessions for review
- Document bug investigation workflows for knowledge base

** Risks
| Risk                              | Mitigation                                        | Owner | Status  |
|-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+-------+---------|
| Build features nobody wants       | Phase 1-4 validation before "CC as a Service"     | @eric | OPEN    |
| Overlap with official CC features | Monitor CC roadmap, focus on power-user/team gaps | @eric | OPEN    |
| Scope creep into IDE territory    | Explicit non-goal: Not building editor/LSP        | @eric | OPEN    |
| Privacy/security for shared logs  | Start read-only, add auth only when needed        | @eric | OPEN    |

** WIP
- [ ] Complete Phase 1 (JSONL parser, tree building) per SPEC.md
- [ ] Validate core value with 5-10 early users (one per persona)
- [ ] Add telemetry to measure most-used commands (projects vs sessions vs export)
- [ ] Prototype read-only session sharing (signed URLs, no auth)
- [ ] Survey demand for remote CC execution (Likert scale, willingness to pay)

** Links
- SPEC: /Users/eric/wrk/src/github.com/claude-code/WIP/251227_claude-code-transcripts/SPEC.md
- Project root: /Users/eric/wrk/src/github.com/claude-code/WIP/251227_claude-code-transcripts/

** Notes
*** Assumptions
- Claude Code session format (JSONL, parentUuid, isSidechain) remains stable across updates
- User demand exists for session browsing beyond official CC UI
- "CC as a Service" has PMF if local inspection proves valuable

*** Constraints
- Read-only access to CLAUDE_CODE_HOME (~/.claude) - no modifications to CC data
- CGO dependency (mattn/go-sqlite3) limits pure-Go portability but acceptable
- Phase 1-4 timeline: 4 weeks for MVP (per SPEC.md implementation phases)

*** Open Questions
- Q: Does official Claude Code roadmap include session browser/export features?
- Q: What % of CC users are non-coders (PMs, designers)? TAM sizing needed.
- Q: Pricing model for "CC as a Service" (per-seat, usage-based, enterprise flat)?
- Q: Self-hosted vs SaaS preference for compliance persona?
- Q: Integration points with existing tools (Notion, Confluence, GitHub, Slack)?

*** Gotchas
- Path encoding algorithm must match Claude Code exactly (reverse-engineer from existing sessions)
- Agent sidechain linking (agentId field) not yet validated against real CC sessions
- Skills system (Lua vs Starlark vs Go plugins) punted to Phase 4, needs decision
- Web UI (Phase 4) competes with =ccx view= terminal rendering - justify both or cut one

*** Non-Goals (Explicit Scope Boundaries)
- NOT building: IDE plugin, LSP server, code editor
- NOT replacing: Claude Code itself, just augmenting with inspection/sharing
- NOT targeting: Non-technical end-users (Excel users, marketers) - too broad
- NOT doing: Real-time collaboration (Google Docs-style) in Phase 1-4
